This is an assignment from The Odin Project.

The goal is to create a site that takes a user input up to 100. For the number entered, the script will create a grid of divs where the number of divs on each side of the square grid will equal the user input. The divs will live inside a grid-container that is fixed in size. Each div will be set to have a hover effect as the user moves their mouse over the grid, creating an 'etch-a-sketch' effect.
